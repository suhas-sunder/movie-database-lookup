# word-search
This project allows users to search for words or related words. Users have the option to either add these words to the default word bank or a favourites playlist. This project makes use of the datamuse API, and is for learning puproses only. I'm building it as a precursor to my larger Typing Test project in order to practice and refesh my skills in working with the PERN stack. It is a practice project that uses PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
